# Pharmako-AI: A Litepaper

## Introduction

*Pharmako-AI* is a groundbreaking collaborative book between K Allado-McDowell and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, exploring the intersection of human consciousness, artificial intelligence, ecology, and cybernetics. Published in August 2020 by Ignota Books, this work presents a unique dialogue, blending essays, stories, and poetry generated through a process of human prompting and AI response.

## Features

* **AI-Human Collaboration:** The book is a direct result of a conversation between Allado-McDowell and GPT-3, with the AI generating approximately 80% of the prose content.
* **Non-Linear Narrative:** GPT-3's output creates a fragmented, non-linear narrative structure, reflecting the associative nature of thought and the fluidity of memory.
* **Thematic Exploration:** The book delves into complex themes, including the co-evolution of human and machine intelligence, post-anthropocentric ecology, biosemiotics, cyberpunk futurism, and the nature of memory and language.
* **Prompt-Driven Generation:** The content is generated through carefully crafted prompts by Allado-McDowell, who acts as a curator and editor, shaping the AI's output.
* **Recursive Techniques:** The creative process involved feeding AI-generated images back into the system as prompts, creating a feedback loop between visual and textual outputs.
* **Text-to-Speech Compatibility:** Available in EPUB format, the book is accessible to a wider audience through text-to-speech software.
