# Aum Golly & Aum Golly 2: A Dive into AI-Human Co-Created Poetry

The *Aum Golly* book series, authored by Jukka Aalho in collaboration with various AI models, presents a unique exploration of the evolving relationship between human creativity and artificial intelligence. The series comprises two volumes, *Aum Golly* (2021) and *Aum Golly 2* (2023), each representing a snapshot in time of the capabilities of generative AI.

## Features

* **AI-Generated Poetry:** Both books feature poems entirely generated by AI models (GPT-3 for *Aum Golly* and ChatGPT for *Aum Golly 2*). The process involved human-designed prompts and curation, but the core text is entirely AI-originated.
* **Cross-Modal Collaboration:** *Aum Golly 2* expands on the first book by incorporating AI-generated illustrations. Midjourney v4 created 23 full-color images based on prompts derived from the poems themselves, showcasing a text-to-image synergy.
* **Time-Constrained Creation:** Both books were created under strict time constraints. *Aum Golly* was generated in a 24-hour sprint, while *Aum Golly 2* was completed in just 12 hours. This highlights the speed and efficiency of AI-assisted creation.
* **Minimal Human Editing:** The raw, unedited output from the AI models is largely preserved, offering a transparent view of the AI's creative process.
* **Exploration of Key Themes:** The series delves into themes such as the ephemeral nature of human and AI roles in creativity, the technological mediation of sensory experience, the emergence of humor in machine improvisation, and the use of metadata as artistic material.

## Benefits

* **Unique Insight into AI Creativity:** The *Aum Golly* series provides a rare glimpse into the creative potential of AI, showcasing its ability to generate unexpected metaphors, explore complex themes, and even produce humor.
* **Documentation of AI Evolution:** The two volumes, created two years apart, document the rapid advancements in generative AI technology.
* **Provocative Reading for Diverse Audiences:** The series appeals to AI ethicists, digital humanities scholars, experimental poetry readers, and anyone interested in the intersection of technology and art.
* **Transparency and Openness:** The project is well-documented, with behind-the-scenes information and process details readily available.

## Potential Applications

* **Academic Research:** The series serves as a valuable case study for research in AI ethics, digital humanities, and computational creativity.
* **Artistic Inspiration:** The books can inspire artists and writers to explore new forms of collaboration with AI.
* **Educational Resource:** The series can be used to educate students about the capabilities and limitations of AI in creative fields.
* **Prompt Engineering Exploration:** Provides concrete examples of prompt engineering techniques used to generate both text and images.

## Technology Used

The *Aum Golly* series leverages cutting-edge AI technologies:

* **GPT-3 (OpenAI):** A large language model with 175 billion parameters, used for generating the poems in *Aum Golly*.
* **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, used for generating the poems in *Aum Golly 2*.
* **Midjourney v4:** An AI image generation model used to create the illustrations in *Aum Golly 2*.
* **Custom Python Scripts:** Used for batch processing and workflow automation.

The project also utilized the LAION-5B dataset for training Midjourney and a 570GB corpus including modern poetry and philosophy texts for GPT-3.
