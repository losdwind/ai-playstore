* **Human-AI Collaboration:** The book is a collaborative effort, with Paul Bellow providing the core narrative, character arcs, and cultural context, while GPT-3 contributed to the in-game elements.
* **Emergent Narrative:** GPT-3 generated non-linear story branches based on the player's (Alex's) in-game decisions.
* **1990s Setting:** The story is deeply rooted in 1990s culture, including references to Y2K anxieties and classic RTS games.
* **Meta-Commentary:** The book explores the potential of human-AI collaboration in problem-solving and creative writing.
