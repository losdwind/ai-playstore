# AI Dungeon: Infinite AI-Powered Text Adventures

## Introduction

AI Dungeon is a revolutionary text-based adventure game that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to create dynamic and limitless storytelling experiences. Unlike traditional text adventures with fixed narratives, AI Dungeon uses large language models (LLMs) to generate unique stories in real-time based on player input, offering unparalleled freedom and creativity.

## Features

* **Dynamic Story Generation:** AI Dungeon uses advanced LLMs (including GPT-3.5/4, Mistral-Large, and Hermes-405b) to generate narrative content on the fly. Players type in actions, and the AI responds with story developments, creating a collaborative storytelling experience.
* **Multiple Genres:** The game supports over 12 genres, including fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, cyberpunk, and more. Players can also create custom worlds and scenarios.
* **Multiplayer Mode:** AI Dungeon offers a robust multiplayer mode where players can co-create stories together, with each player contributing to the narrative.
* **Image Generation:** Enhance your adventures with AI-generated images. AI Dungeon integrates Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 HD to visually represent scenes and characters within the story.
* **Memory System:** The game tracks over 50 story elements, including characters, locations, and plot points, to maintain context and coherence within the narrative.
* **Freemium Model:** AI Dungeon offers both free and paid subscription tiers. Paid tiers provide access to more powerful AI models, increased context windows (up to 16k tokens), and premium features.
* **Cross-Platform Availability:** Play anywhere on web browsers, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS devices.
