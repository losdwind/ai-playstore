# DeepSeek-R1: A Comprehensive Overview

DeepSeek-R1 is a state-of-the-art, open-source reasoning AI developed by DeepSeek AI. It leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with a staggering 671 billion parameters, yet only activates 37 billion per query, making it highly efficient. This model excels in complex reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and text generation, achieving performance comparable to larger, more resource-intensive models.

## Key Features and Benefits

* **High Performance:** Achieves 92.3% on HumanEval (Python), 85.4% on MATH, 89.1% on GSM8K, and 78.6 on CodeXGLUE benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in code and mathematical reasoning.
* **Cost-Effective:** Trained with a budget of only $6 million, significantly lower than comparable models.
* **Large Context Window:** Supports a 128K token context window, enabling processing of extensive documents and codebases.
* **Open Source:** Released under the permissive MIT License, fostering collaboration and innovation.
* **Reinforcement Learning Driven:** Employs direct reinforcement learning (RL) instead of supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leading to emergent behaviors like chain-of-thought verification.
* **Multilingual:** Supports both English and Chinese, with Gaokao-level proficiency in Chinese.
* **Enterprise-Grade Safety:** Integrates with Azure AI Content Safety and utilizes constitutional AI principles for robust safety and alignment.
* **Multiple API Access:** Provides API access via Azure AI Foundry, Together AI, and NVIDIA NIM.
